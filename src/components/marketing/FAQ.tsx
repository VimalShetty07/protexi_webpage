  { q: "How long does it take to set up Protexi?",             a: "Most teams are up and running within 48 hours. Our onboarding specialist guides you through importing worker data, configuring alert thresholds, and setting up your compliance calendar. No technical expertise required." },
  { q: "How does Protexi keep our data secure?",               a: "Protexi is hosted on ISO 27001 certified UK infrastructure. All data is encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3). Fully GDPR compliant with a Data Processing Agreement on all paid plans." },
  { q: "Is Protexi aligned with UKVI requirements?",           a: "Yes. Built specifically around UK Visas and Immigration Sponsor Guidance. Every workflow, report template, and alert maps directly to Home Office expectations. We update instantly when UKVI guidance changes." },
  { q: "Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan at any time?",      a: "Absolutely. Upgrade instantly from the billing dashboard — features activate immediately. Downgrades take effect at the end of your billing cycle. No lock-in periods on Starter or Growth." },
  { q: "What happens if a worker's visa expiry is missed?",    a: "Protexi sends escalating alerts at 90, 60, 30, and 7 days before expiry. If an expiry passes without action, the profile is auto-flagged 'Action Required' and your HR admin receives an urgent notification." },
  { q: "Does Protexi integrate with our existing HR system?",  a: "Growth and Enterprise plans include API access. Enterprise includes pre-built connectors for Workday, BambooHR, HiBob, and major ATS systems. Custom integrations also available." },

  { q: "Do you offer a free trial?",                           a: "Yes! Starter and Growth plans come with a 14-day free trial — no credit card required. Full feature access from day one. Book a demo and we'll set yours up immediately." },
